## 📂 Overview

This project analyzes how drought has affected vegetation health in Germany over the last four decades using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Landsat satellite imagery.

The repository includes:
- Python scripts for raster preprocessing and reprojection
- NDVI calculation using red and NIR bands
- Seasonal mosaicking of Landsat bands
- Extraction of NDVI statistics by administrative regions
- Processed NDVI rasters and CSV outputs
